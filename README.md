# Puppet module for the New Relic infrastructure agent

This Puppet module installs and configures the [New Relic infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure) and [on-host integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/).

## Install and use the Puppet module

### What the `newrelic-infra` Puppet module affects

* Adds the New Relic Infrastructure package repository source.
* Installs and configures the New Relic Infrastructure agent.

### Getting started with `newrelic-infra`

Start by declaring the main `::agent` class.

### Usage

All interactions with `newrelic-infra` are done through the main `agent` class.

#### Install the infrastructure agent

Use the following snippet to install the infrastructure agent:

```ruby
class { 'newrelic_infra::agent':
    ensure      => 'latest',
    license_key => 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
}
```

## Reference

### Classes

#### Public classes

* [`newrelic_infra::agent`](#newrelic_infraagent): Installs and configures the Infrastructure agent.

### `newrelic_infra::agent`

#### Parameters

##### `ensure`

Specifies the Infrastructure agent `ensure` status.

Supported values include:

* `'latest'` - (default) Installs the latest agent version.
* `'absent'` - Uninstalls the agent.
* `string` - String containing a specific version to pin

##### `license_key`

Specifies the New Relic license key to use.

##### `display_name` (Optional)

Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting.

##### `verbose` (Optional)

Enables verbose logging for the agent when the value is set to 1. Default value is 0.

##### `log_file` (Optional)

To log to another location, provide a full path and file name. When not set, the agent logs to the system log files.

Typical default locations:

* Amazon Linux, CentOS, RHEL: `/var/log/messages`
* Debian, Ubuntu: `/var/log/syslog`
* Windows Server: `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\newrelic-infra.log`

##### `proxy` (Optional)

Sets the proxy server the agent should use. Examples:

* `https://myproxy.foo.com:8080`
* `http://10.10.254.254`

##### `custom_attributes` (Optional)

A hash of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance.

##### `custom_configs` (Optional)

A hash of agent configuration directives that are not exposed explicitly. Example:

`{'payload_compression' => 0, 'selinux_enable_semodule' => false}`

##### `windows_provider` (Optional)

Allows for the selection of a provider other than `windows` for the [Windows MSI install](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-windows-server-using-msi-installer). Or allows the Windows provider to be used if another provider such as Chocolatey has been specified as default in the Puppet installation.

 ##### `windows_temp_folder` (Optional)

A string value for the temporary folder to download and install the MSI windows installation file. Example:

```
windows_temp_folder => 'C:/Windows/Temp'
```

##### `package_repo_ensure` (Optional)

A flag for omitting the New Relic package repo. Meant for environments where the `newrelic-infra` package has been mirrored to another repo that's already present on the system (set it to `absent` to achieve this).

### Installing the infrastructure on-host integrations

In order to install integrations you can use the `integrations` class. The list of available integrations can be found [here][3].

The `newrelic_infra::integrations`, has a parameter named `integrations` which should be a hash of:

```
{
  '<integration_package>' => { ensure => <state> },
  ...
}
```

The integrations package name is located in the **Install and activate** section of the [individual integrations docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations). As a convention, their name is the name of the service with the nri- prefix (`nri-apache`, `nri-redis`, etc.).

```ruby
class { 'newrelic_infra::integrations':
  integrations => {
    'nri-mysql' => { ensure => present },
    'nri-redis' => { ensure => latest },
    'nri-rabbitmq' => { ensure => absent }
  }
}
```

The source code for each integration is available on [newrelic's github organization][4].

#### Removing `newrelic-infra-integrations` package and its bundled integrations

> This only applies if you have the `newrelic-infra-integrations` package installed

If you want to remove the `newrelic-infra-integrations` package or any of the bundled integrations (nri-redis, nri-cassandra, nri-apache, nri-nginx, nri-mysql),  add `newrelic-infra-integrations` as the first item of the `integrations` hash argument with an `ensure => absent`.

```ruby
class { 'newrelic_infra::integrations':
  integrations => {
    'newrelic-infra-integrations' => { ensure => absent },
    'nri-mysql'                   => { ensure => absent },
    'nri-redis'                   => { ensure => latest },
  }
}
```

Otherwise, you might get the following error:

```
Error: Execution of '/bin/rpm -e nri-mysql-1.1.5-1.x86_64' returned 1: error: Failed dependencies:
        nri-mysql is needed by (installed) newrelic-infra-integrations-0:1.7.0-1.x86_64
```

That is because the `newrelic-infra-integrations` has a dependency on those packages, so you need to remove it before removing any of the others.
